Fast subsets of large datasets with Pandas and SQLite\n","\n","Let’s say you have a large amount of data, too large to fit in memory, and you want to load part of it into Pandas. If you’re only going to load one specific subset a single time, you can use chunking.\n","\n","But what if you need to load different subsets of the data at different times? Loading the whole file each time will be slow.\n","\n","What you need is a searchable index, and one easy (and fast!) way to do that is with SQLite.\n","\n","https://pythonspeed.com/articles/indexing-pandas-sqlite/"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>index</th>\n","      <th>country_name</th>\n","      <th>country_code</th>\n","      <th>indicator_name</th>\n","      <th>indicator_code</th>\n","      <th>debt</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Afghanistan</td>\n","      <td>AFG</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>7.289445e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>12</td>\n","      <td>Albania</td>\n","      <td>ALB</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>3.171945e+08</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>37</td>\n","      <td>Algeria</td>\n","      <td>DZA</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>1.032077e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>56</td>\n","      <td>Angola</td>\n","      <td>AGO</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>1.092402e+10</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>78</td>\n","      <td>Armenia</td>\n","      <td>ARM</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>4.269592e+08</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>118</th>\n","      <td>2260</td>\n","      <td>Venezuela, RB</td>\n","      <td>VEN</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>5.210485e+08</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>119</th>\n","      <td>2284</td>\n","      <td>Vietnam</td>\n","      <td>VNM</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>6.494122e+09</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>120</th>\n","      <td>2306</td>\n","      <td>Yemen, Rep.</td>\n","      <td>YEM</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>4.021139e+08</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>121</th>\n","      <td>2318</td>\n","      <td>Zambia</td>\n","      <td>ZMB</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>1.502400e+09</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>122</th>\n","      <td>2343</td>\n","      <td>Zimbabwe</td>\n","      <td>ZWE</td>\n","      <td>Disbursements on external debt, long-term (DIS...</td>\n","      <td>DT.DIS.DLXF.CD</td>\n","      <td>4.439603e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>123 rows × 6 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["     index   country_name country_code  \\\n","0        0    Afghanistan          AFG   \n","1       12        Albania          ALB   \n","2       37        Algeria          DZA   \n","3       56         Angola          AGO   \n","4       78        Armenia          ARM   \n","..     ...            ...          ...   \n","118   2260  Venezuela, RB          VEN   \n","119   2284        Vietnam          VNM   \n","120   2306    Yemen, Rep.
